#### What it is
jadelizard is an interactive options strategy graphing calculator.

#### Features:

##### Notes
* For strategies with multiple expiration dates, jadelizard will calculate the value of the strategy at the first expiration date. The assumption is made that the risk-free rate of return and values for the underlying instrument (volatility, dividend yield) will remain constant until expiration. 
* The pricing models jadelizard uses for valuation are purely theoretical. jadelizard is a visualization tool to be used in an educational capacity.
